# TOFA7A: I THINK I Can Improve `invited users within the Channel Class`
# TOFA7A: InvitedNick get and set, would be better if it takes a user class, AM JUST SAYING I MIGHT BE WRONG
# TOFA7A: Operators too
# TOFA7A: ServertoClient and ClientToClient and thingToThing will be moved out The User Class, User is not responsible for that
# TOFA7A: User.getMembers() & User.getOperators() will be removed, instead it will be getMember(NICKname), getMember(FD) is already there, no need to get the whole list
# TOFA7A: getInvitedNick() Which is see if the nickname associated with a user, is invited or not, has to add an alphabet case validation
# TOFA7A: I mean it will be better if we user isUserInvited(fd) instead of getInvitedNick(Nickname) since no validation is required 

Empty channel from members

# TOFA7A: A NEW ERROR DETECTED "when user quit the server " and rejoin again he satys within the channel
# TOFA7A: I think getServerIp should be moved to Database
